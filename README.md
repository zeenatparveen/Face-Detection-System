# Face-Detection-System
Built a Face detection system which can detect faces in images as well as videos using Haar Cascades in OpenCV and Python.It is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images, digital cameras use face detection for autofocus.
In this use-case we will try to detect the face of individuals using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
